# C-Practice

- Simple repository for C exercises.

- In each exercise, there is the problem that is being solved.

- There is no pointers on any exercise, the point of this repo is practicing logic and algorithms.

- This repo can and will be changed in the future.


## Compiling

- Make sure you have a `C compiler` in your machine first.

      gcc --version

- I'm using Linux (debian-based distro [ZorinOS](https://zorin.com/os/download/)), so there will be diferent commands for [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/?r=1) or [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/br/os/macos/). 

- To compile to the bin folder

      gcc <filename>.c -o ../bin/<executable name>

## Running

- To run the executable, use:

      ./<executable name>
